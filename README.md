# AI Speech Synthesizer(Text to Speech App) and GPT powered ChatBot

This repository is an AI application developed using Python and implemented in streamlit as an app. By using these applications, I am trying to develop the AI VideoBot similar to the Human touch AI D-ID chatBot "Alice".

Before trying these applications, create your streamlit account using the link https://streamlit.io/, provide your E-mail ID as a login ID  and authorise streamlit to use your GitHub account linked with your same Mail ID.
